# licker-api-maker
This is a simple api maker in python

To setup use "pip install -r requirements.txt"

##Warning this only works on linux tested on raspberry pi
I might a windows support later!

To use in the lists folder add a txt file called whatever you want,
then use --namehere-- and --namehere end-- in the middle you can enter any text you want
and it will pick a random line in the middle of the --namehere--'s and give you a json output of
{"data":"randomItem"}
there has to be two --nameheres-- / sub elements to work for example you could use main and other\

By the way this will run on port 1237 and the Online Handler will make it public on the url in "output.txt"
